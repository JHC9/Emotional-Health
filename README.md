# Imagine-Health
Detects user emotions using the model from https://github.com/Kakarot-2000/Project-Illumina. It then tracks how many times user shows emotion for a period of time. Afterwards, it outputs a mental wellness score using a linear regression model. Training data size for second model is a bit small. Hence the output score may not be that accurate for now. Since there isn't enough storage and ram in replit, we decided to do it locally.
